Now I'll say at the outset, I agree that estimating is a hazardous exercise, filled with sources of error, some of which are themselves poorly understood. And that this is particularly true if you are estimating something that truly has little or nothing in common with anything you've previously delivered (otherwise you're simply estimating by analogy, which is perfectly fine).

And yes, sometimes organisations estimate because estimating is what they do. It can simply be a ritual.

However, let's think about a couple of the needs that are often behind a request for an estimate, rather than simply going on and doing the work. Often the thinking is as a method of risk reduction - reduce the uncertainty around the risk that the work will cost more than it's worth, or (worse) that it will cost so much that we can't afford to finish it, so don't get any value. 

Now you might think that this is a foolish quest for certainty. But usually the people looking for estimates aren't <em>that</em> stupid. They're generally not expecting a perfect estimate, that is correct to the penny.

But what they <em>are</em> looking for is a material reduction in uncertainty. That gives them a better idea of what to expect <em>before</em> deciding to do it, and gives them a more solid option to <em>not</em> do it. Effectively, what you're doing is converting a commitment into an option, which is (nearly) always a worthwhile exercise.

If you're creating value, it follows that the work that you undertake to create it cannot be waste.

The bigger question therefore is not whether estimating is valuable activity, but is it valuable <em>enough</em>? Is the value of the option worth more than you pay for it? Can you create the same (or near enough) option in an easier way? This is why lightweight rapid relative estimating (<a href="http://dannorth.net/2013/08/08/blink-estimation/">Blink Estimating</a>, Storypoints or even <a href="http://theitriskmanager.wordpress.com/2014/07/27/saint-sebastian-and-scaling-agile/">Sweet Wild Ass Guesses</a>) can be powerful.

My programmer friends I'm sure will be thinking at this point: what about a technical spike? Absolutely, that would be another method of assessing technical opportunities and risks which might inform other estimated factors.

<blockquote class="aside quoteright">Estimates should not be confused with quotations or deadlines (although they may be a factor in defining both of those). They are not promises, nor should they be only concerned with cost and schedule. They are an expert assessment of all kinds of factors, including quality (another misused and misunderstood word!), people capacity and technical capability.</blockquote>
