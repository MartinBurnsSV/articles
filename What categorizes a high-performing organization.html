The essential characteristic of a high-performing group, or organization, is its high propulsion, agility, innovation, and job satisfaction. Have we heard of these fantastic conditions before? Absolutely! Have we seen them well anchored and sustainable exercised? Not so sure.. The goal for this document is to give you an insight into not only what, but also how to incorporate a more efficient way of work in a group or a whole organization.
 

The challenge
Most of the corporate businesses, if not all, marketing their services and products based on trends and needs - they are market oriented. You would probably agree that this is a prerequisite for a company to survive at all. And if they want to go from survival to profitability, the organization must also take their business plans from the present into the future, and dynamically execute the same in real time. All this is well known.
 
But what about the organization itself? How does it look between business promoters and those who supposed to implement these initiatives? Unfortunately it is not as common to create harmony between the organization and the business, and by that business and organizational development gets out of phase. There are many reasons for this, where the most common is about habit and security.
 
When it comes to organization development, we have taken the habit to require well-defined future conditions of the organization to be developed. Historically, this has been an obvious target, which gives the feeling of security.
An imminent danger today is that this security creates inertia. First, the change in the project, but also later in the group or organization who supposed to embrace new ways of working. This side effect will be if possible ridiculously paradoxical when an organization implements a change project aimed at flow efficiency (read: Lean), in which the project around the same time partially creates the opposite.
If I may make a childishly simple metaphor, it is the parent who red faced, with "cane" in hand and shrill voice requires the child to calms down.
 

The possibility
When we have a need for a more efficient and responsive group, or organization, then we have to makes sure that the change project become a part of the result. One can say that the change project "live" what the project wants to achieve. In this case ..
- Strong propulsion (we experience rapid positive results)
- Flexibility (with minimal effort and exertion)
- Innovative (we take advantage of what we have)
- Job satisfaction (a pleasurable trip)
 
When a project itself has lived what we intend to achieve, then the desirable states above will permeate the organization; from managers to leaders, teams and individual employees. For it is the latter that will create the desirable gear ratio, and thus success.  
 
 
Curiosity - a part of the innovative approach
A common question at this point is; which method should we use to start developing this high-performing and responsive organization? I want to emphasize that there is no need for an all-encompassing methodology. This means that the group or organization may use any methodology they want. Instead I advocate (and also offer) a simple framework which incorporate and supplement whatever methodology the organization is using. This framework is based on one foundation, with four related principles.
The foundation is simply to primarily work with the reality before the plan. Well, aimless work then? No, on the contrary, as one of the four principles below decree. Here are four principles in turn:
 
Supportive approach
The first and perhaps most important principle is all about our attitude towards our surrounding. Where we have a genuine interest in other people. For example, I think plenty of others, until proven otherwise. I enjoy working with others, and others enjoy working with me. Or as the African proverb say; If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go further, go together. 
 
Value Driven
First and foremost, value driven is not about core values ​​and such. Value Driven is all about delivering value based on a purpose. Our vision is to create value every day, where the purpose of my work is my guiding light. Goals and objectives are thereby subordinated to this principle. Or if you want; goals and objectives are developed based on the principle of (for example) value-driven cooperation.

Iterative planning
This is the most comprehensive and complex principle. But if I should keep it short, it's about to let go of old paradigms about the plan-driven planning, and from a cyclical perspective plan on multiple levels - simultaneously.
 
Incremental development
Classically there are separate processes for change management, which can sometimes serve as countermeasures for new conditions. High-performing organizations assumes that things will change, and therefore have change management built-in to its daily work. A little sloppy, you can translate this principle into pragmatic change management. But it is never arbitrary, instead this principle is fairly rigorous.
