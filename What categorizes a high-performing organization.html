<p class="lede">The essential characteristic of a high-performing group, or organization, is its high propulsion, agility, innovation, and job satisfaction. </p>

<p class="lede">Have we heard of these fantastic conditions before? Absolutely! Have we seen them well anchored and sustainable exercised? Not so sure...</p>

The goal for this post is to give you an insight into not only <em>what</em>, but also <em>how</em> to incorporate a more efficient way of work in a group or a whole organization.
 
<h2>The challenge</h2>
	Most of the corporate businesses, if not all, marketing their services and products based on trends and needs - they are market oriented. You would probably agree that this is a prerequisite for a company to survive at all. And if they want to go from survival to profitability, the organization must also take their business plans from the present into the future, and dynamically execute the same in real time. All this is well known.
 
	But what about the organization itself? How does it look between business promoters and those who supposed to implement these initiatives? Unfortunately it is not as common to create harmony between the organization and the business, and by that business and organizational development gets out of phase. There are many reasons for this, where the most common is about habit and security.
 
	When it comes to organization development, we have taken the habit to require well-defined future conditions of the organization to be developed. Historically, this has been an obvious target, which gives the feeling of security.

	An imminent danger today is that this security creates inertia. First, the change in the project, but also later in the group or organization who supposed to embrace new ways of working. This side effect will be if possible ridiculously paradoxical when an organization implements a change project aimed at flow efficiency (read: <a href="http://www.leanblog.org/2007/03/lean-or-lame/">Lean</a>), in which the project around the same time partially creates the opposite.

	If I may make a childishly simple metaphor, it is the parent who red faced, with cane in hand and shrill voice requires the child to calm down.
 

<h2>The possibility</h2>
	When we have a need for a more efficient and responsive group, or organization, then we have to makes sure that the change project become a part of the result. One can say that the change project "lives" what the project wants to achieve. In this case:

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Strong propulsion</strong> (we experience rapid positive results)</li>
		<li><strong>Flexibility</strong> (with minimal effort and exertion)</li>
		<li><strong>Innovation</strong> (we take advantage of what we have)</li>
		<li><strong>Job satisfaction</strong> (a pleasurable trip)</li>
	</ul> 

	<p class="lede">When a project itself has lived what we intend to achieve, then the desirable states above will permeate the organization; from managers to leaders, teams and individual employees. For it is the latter that will create the desirable gear ratio, and thus success.<p> â€ƒ
