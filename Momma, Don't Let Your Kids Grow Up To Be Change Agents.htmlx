<p class="lede">Being a Lean Change Agent is really, really hard. It's thankless, career limiting and painful. But hugely rewarding.</p>

<p class="lede">However, it's a one way trip, so be very careful before you embark on the journey of 'Better'.</p>

And you start seeing queues everywhere. 

I can't go through an airport now without feeling physical pain at all the queues. Queue for the car park. Queue for checkin/bag drop. Queue for security. Queue for boarding. Queue for your seat. Queue to get off.  Queue for immigration. Queue for bag collection. Queue for customs. Queue for taxi (while the taxis are <em>also queuing for passengers</em>!!). The red mist is rising just thinking about it. At least I don't have to do this every week any more.

Being a Lean Change Agent is <em>fantastic</em>. I get to hack with people's <em>heads</em>.
