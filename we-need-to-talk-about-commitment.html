	Commitment should mean something to both parties - that's how you generate Trust. But it doesn't mean cast iron guarantees either.

## The Problem of Commitment and Best Efforts

 There's lots of negativity about the idea of commitment out in the Blog and Twitter spheres. Canonical Scrum itself has taken on this view, replacing the concept of a Sprint Commitment with the much broader and lighter Scrum Forecast.

 Reading these pieces, it's easy to infer that the only possible reading of 'Commitment' is as an externally imposed set of unrealistic expectations. That it's close to a cast iron guarantee of outcomes, reaching which requires the onerous, frequently cited legal standard of <q>Best Efforts</q> as an absolute obligation that binds the promisor to spending unlimited amounts of money, time, and effort if necessary to fulfil the expectation.

 Clearly in a context of high uncertainty &mdash; which Software Development of anything beyond trivial always is &mdash; this would be unrealistic.

 This reading is problematic in another way: Commitment is something that can never be imposed from the outside. I can only commit myself to do something; you can never commit me on my behalf (unless you have my clear proxy to do so, which is often a cause for dispute in relationships. Ask my wife...).

 If this reading is accurate, then indeed Commitment would be an unattainable and undesirable approach.

 The interesting thing is, while this is the generally accepted view of <q>Best Efforts</q>, [it's not actually accurate in either UK or US law](http://www.jonesday.com/Best-Efforts-and-EndeavoursCase-Analysis-and-Practical-Guidance-Under-US-and-UK-Law-07-30-2007) (YMMV in other jurisdictions). It's more accurate to understand that Best Efforts should not be overly burdensome nor unrealistic, nor detrimental to the promisor. That said, the Best Efforts standard

## A Better Commitment

 Diligence, honesty, fairness. That doesn't sound too bad to me. And SAFe&reg;'s view of Commitment is closer to this. It goes something like:

 > We will diligently work in good faith and to the extent of our capabilities to achieve what we are committing to within all identified constraints. This is because, knowing what we know now, we honestly believe, from our understanding of the request and our experience of similar kinds of work, that it is reasonable and realistic to achieve it.
 >
 > However, we recognise that we have a high degree of uncertainty, and there are many known, unknown and unknowable unknowns, which together may make that commitment unachievable. Should this happen, or be likely to happen, we will clearly call it out at the earliest opportunity, allowing the maximum timescale to find alternative options. And that has to be 100% acceptable to all parties.

 An example might be helpful here. Imagine that you are remodelling your home, including combining two rooms into one by removing a partition wall.
