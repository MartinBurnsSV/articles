<p class="lede">I'm delighted to announce that I'll be speaking at <a href="http://www.leanagilescotland.com">Lean Agile Scotland</a> for the third year running. <a href="http://www.leanagilescotland.com/speakers#martinburns"><img src="http://everydaylean.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/LAS14_SpeakerBadge.png" alt="I&#039;m a speaker at Lean Agile Scotland 2014, Sept 11-12" width="190" height="120" class="alignright size-full wp-image-141554" /></a></p>

<p class="lede">This year, I will have two entirely new sessions, one of which will be 100% unique to this conference.</p>

<h2 style="clear:both">Talk: Independence, Devo-Max and Centralisation: Power Structures in Delivery Organisations</h2>

	<p style="clear:both">This is the unique one. This is the only conference and the only week when I can give this. Pivoting wildly from <a href="http://scotreferendum.com">Scotland's Referendum on Independence</a> which will be held the following week, it explores how Agile is as much a political movement as a process improvement one, and differing approaches to transformation.</p>

	<strong>Note for those living and voting in Scotland:</strong> I will <em>not</em> be telling you how I think you should vote. I don't live there any more, and thus have excluded myself from officially having a view other than that it's for you to decide.

<h2 style="clear:both">Workshop: Building the Boardwalk Empire: Visual Management in Action</h2>

	I'm extremely happy to be developing and delivering this workshop together with my super smart <a href="http://www.avegagroup.se">Avega</a> colleague <a href="http://hakanforss.wordpress.com">HÃ¥kan Forss</a>.

	In this hands-on, experience-based workshop, we'll be using visual management of risks and issues as a gateway drug to learning gemba-based management behaviours and active coaching dialogues. And maybe just a bit more empathy for PHBs.

<h2>Tickets</h2>

	At time of writing (7th August), there are still some tickets left, although you have missed the early bird discounts.
