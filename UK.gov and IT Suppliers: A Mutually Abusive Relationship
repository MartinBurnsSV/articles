<p class="lede">Last week, I saw <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25884915?utm_content=buffer07d45&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer">yet another angry piece about how the IT industry is taking its government customers for a ride</a>. Like many pieces before it, it cites unattributed, uncontextualised assertions as Shock! Horror! facts, managing to cast unfair aspersions on both suppliers and customers.</p> 
<p class="lede">Like many pieces before it, it is almost entirely misleading in detail, while being absolutely spot on in overall substance.</p>

For context, I have worked on a number of assignments with major IT suppliers at central government departments. On most of them, I have been in a project management or commercial role, most recently in the team that solutioned and defined commercials for delivery projects against departmental requests. I don't claim to have perfect experience of every supplier, or every govt department, but what I've seen and talked to others about suggests that what I'm describing is fairly typical.

The other preamble note: I'm not going to talk about specific projects, even where I have some limited inside knowledge. I'm trying to get away from specific instances used as a cudgel to beat up the participants, so will be generalising a little. I also want to avoid nitpicking. Yes, this is all my interpretation, but I'm just not going to enter into Redherringism. I do know that the accusations thrown at initiatives I've seen the inside of them rarely reflect the reality. By the time <em>you</em> hear about them, it's no longer in the realm of reality, but that of politics, at which point the chances becoming any better at this are disappearingly remote.

I thought I'd cut through the politics a little and talk about the environment that this kind of work is done in, and perhaps generate a little sympathy for the poor sods on the ground on both sides of the contractual divide who generally are trying to do the best job of work they can. So, in the spirit of <span lang="ja" style="font-style:italic">genchi genbutsu</span>, here are a few contextual snippets that will help understand these stories in the future.
