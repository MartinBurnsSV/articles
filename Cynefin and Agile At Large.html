Over the last few months, I’ve gained a growing appreciation of how useful Dave Snowden’s Cynefin framework is for understanding many of the conflicts we have. I’m not going to do a full intro to Cynefin here - for a start, I don’t think I’m qualified, and also, there are some very nice summaries out there.

Everyday Kanban: Understanding the Cynefin framework – a basic intro http://www.everydaykanban.com/2013/09/29/understanding-the-cynefin-framework/

And short enough to be quotable here:
When you listen to Dave, he throws out ideas at a prestigious rate of knots. It’s very hard to understand live in a conference, and usually takes a couple of watchings of the YouTube to get it. And even then, it really helps having very smart friends who have deeper understanding, and can differentiate between ideas and opinions.
So I’m going to shamelessly steal thoughts from a couple of smart, Cynefin-understanding friends in this, specifically the aforementioned Liz and Chris, plus Kevin Behr who I was immensely privileged to spend time with when he was in Stockholm the other week. The smart bits of what follows is mostly theirs. The horrible twisting into new forms is mostly mine.
Enterprise Software
So let’s talk about Enterprise Software. By which I mean software used by large organisations to facilitate their core business, and make the operating model actually work, but generally is not the core value they generate. This isn’t just obvious software companies, but also excludes core banking platforms, as in many respects, a bank is just a software company with a license to print money. Literally in some cases.

I started wondering about this when a colleague in our SAP practise asked how Agile might work in a SAP deployment, when SAP has its own method, which is effective enough for customers to pay very good money in large amounts for it.
And I continued wondering while working on a RFP to develop a collaboration system that would have been significantly based on Sharepoint. My Sharepoint SME told me that we wouldn’t need a development DBA, as in Sharepoint you’re apparently not supposed to touch the Database: Sharepoint itself handles it all at the logical and physical model level, and everything goes through defined APIs.
And I thought back to some of the systems I’d developed based on Kana IQ and some of the CRM work I’d done with Siebel and other marketing platforms.
And with my growing understanding of Cynefin, and Chris Matts’ words ringing in my ears that all businesses in competitive environments are complex, I wondered: where did the complexity live? Because in none of those systems did we have or need bespoke software development beyond building a few (both application and user) interfaces.
And I thought back to the most complex environment I’d ever worked in (at least, run a team in): a customer whose J2EE based call centre system was a textbook Big Ball of Mud. Introducing new products - even near duplicates of existing ones - took hundreds if not thousands of days of technical effort involving deep Java coding. And I remembered our opinion, which is that each new product should have been introduced simply as a data change, largely definable by business users.
