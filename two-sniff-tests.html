<p class="lede">When joining a new team, ask to see evidence of their tests and customer interactions, and use the way they respond as a quick maturity assessment<p>

One of the hardest points of working with any new team, either as a coach, or as a manager, is to understand their current level of maturity. You need to do this quickly to be able to calibrate the your interaction and ambition for improvement, as pitching the wrong tone to the team will damage your relationship from the start. A high maturity team can feel that you are dragging them backwards, while a low maturity team will see you as a know-all expert that lacks empathy.

In this circumstance, the team's own view will often be biased, either self-deluded via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunningâ€“Kruger_effect">the Dunning-Kruger effect</a>, or wishing to give you a view that may not be the truth. This will be especially true if the team themselves have not asked for your help, but you have been brought in by some level of management. Until you have a better understanding of them, it will be hard to assess whether and to what extent these biases exist.

So you need a quick (which is more important than high precision) way of understanding where on the learning and maturity journey they are, and whether you need to start addressing fundamentals.

I have a simple, two part sniff test that I use, which has shown strong fidelity as a predictor of team core competence.

<h2>1: <q>Can you please show me your tests?</q></h2>

	The point of this is not to audit the tests, assess test coverage or any other metric. At this point, asking this hits a number of points:

	You can get a lot of information simply from the tone of response. If the team can point you to some kind of repository or visual management almost instantly with a <q>It's over there. Fill your boots. Come back with any questions</q> relaxed tone (or even an impatient one: an unspoken <q>you idiot</q> is a <em>good</em> thing!) then that's a very good sign. It means they actually have some consistent, thought through ways of working and have a way of transmitting them to new joiners.
		
	If, on the other hand, you are deflected with something like <q>Yeah, we have all that</q> but not a simple pointer to where it is, then at best, it's in someone's head and we're operating on the basis of rumour.
		
	<strong>Note that I don't care <em>how</em> it's stored.</strong> Github, Sharepoint, fileserver, Cucumber, <acronym title="Rational Team Concert">RTC</acronym>, whiteboard: it's all fine. And re whiteboard, as long as any member of the team can describe it to me on a white board with some consistency between team members, that's fine too.

This doesn't mean that you are imposing Scrum-like ceremonies on the team, which will be particularly problematic if the reality is that they have evolved out of it.

<h2>1: <q>Can you please invite me to your stakeholder demoes?</q></h2>

<h2>Important Caveats</h2>
This is simply a quick diagnostic assessment, designed for speed rather than precision. It will not tell you everything, and is only a first pass. You should maintain an open mind, ready to be proven wrong in this, always receptive to new evidence, confirmatory or otherwise.
