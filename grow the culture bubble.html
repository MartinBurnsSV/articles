<h2>Grow the Culture Bubble</h2>

<p class="lede">Once you've established a culture bubble, the way to maximise its benefits is to grow it. Scale the bubble to incorporate ever more of the value stream.</p>

The early Christian church was great at this. Rather than obsessing about keeping separate from the pagan world and wishing it were already converted, it engaged with the world. St Paul, preaching in Athens, absolutely started from where the Athenians were, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-23.htm">talking in terms of an Unknown God they already worshipped</a>.

So having built some organisational trust by making and coming through on commitments, and doing so better than the organisation would expect (and if you're not doing this, then what are you doing bringing disruptive change to an organisation without benefit?), start talking to the immediate teams.

At this point, do <strong>NOT</strong> bring the heavy theology of the Agile Manifesto and weird role names that don't help people understand how to interact with you. 

Start by discovering the needs of those teams. Act as the customer of upstream towards the business, and the supplier of downstream towards production. Understand what being a better customer and supplier would mean for those teams. What are their needs? Not just as expressed, but work hard to uncover the real need.

For example, upstream will often insist on estimates. No matter how convinced you are of the unreliability of bottom up estimating, you won't win that argument by insisting that they're ignorant for wanting them, or by refusing to provide them (if you do that, someone will merely estimate on your behalf, with even <em>less</em> knowledge). 

Understand what need sits underneath the request. Meet that need effectively and the specific request will go away.



<h2>Hard Conversations with Business</h2>

In most cases, the downstream teams will be easier to talk to: you can use technical language and in many cases they will have already been exposed to some of the ideas involved. The main discussion there will be <q>How?</q> 

<blockquote class="quoteright">
But you know this already. It's already in your DNA: introduce MVP as quickly as possible and iterate towards vision, adjusting the vision as you go.
</blockquote>

Note that this will rarely be technically how, but how to do it in a way that doesn't change the governance framework. Because for sure, a partial implementation within the governance framework is going to be a lot more effective than waiting to change the framework.

However, the business will be tougher, because you will have less common language and experience to fall back on. There, however, the questions will be similar: delivering faster and more responsively to changing business needs sounds like <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/G/Good-Thing.html">A Good Thing</a>. But how do we do that without breaking the governance framework and incurring significant additional risk (that the governance framework is designed to reduce)?

Because - absent an existing crisis and acknowledgement that things are broken and need change - the Kanban Method is spot on in that you can only start from where you are now. Corporate culture is conservative, and if it weren't, you wouldn't need to be having these conversations. It has long experience in a number of behaviours which it considers to be the foundation of its success to date. You're turning up with a critique of those behaviours, but all the evidence is on their side. Put yourself in their shoes: why would you accept change on any rational basis?

<blockquote class="quoteright">Again, you know this already. Getting closer to the business is baked into the Agile Principles. If you don't find yourself becoming more empathetic to their needs and taking on some of their culture as you export yours, you're possibly not trying hard enough.</blockquote>
So again, you need to show empathy. You need to understand their needs and world view. You need to come up with ways of working that support those needs rather than your doctrine. And leave the revolutionary language at home.

<p class="lede">One of the most important factors in a successful Lean/Agile transformation is understanding and trust from management. Gaining this takes empathy and engagement. If you're proposing change, gaining this is your responsibility, so think about how you should modify your behaviour.</p>
