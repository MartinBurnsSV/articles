Many large organisations, particularly in regulated industries such as banking and pharmaceuticals, have adopted something along the lines of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Model_(software_development)">'V' model of systems engineering</a>.

Conceptually simple, and offering powerful auditability and clear <a href="http://www.processor.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/p2844/33p44/33p44.asp">Separation of Duties</a> process safeguards, this is highly attractive to corporate governance, for whom a failure can bring at best a regulatory impact, and at worst, a <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/12/03/rbs_it_outage/">political and PR firestorm</a>. And not just in banking, but in other industries too. If you supply mobile telephony base stations and they fail, you're paying very large sums of money to the network operators in short order. And if you're supplying hardware or software to those base station suppliers, and it's your component that caused the failure, you can be sure that those fines are going to be passed on to you, with the addition of contingent damages and costs.

Well publicised failures in the last few years have made it very clear to managers that being found responsible for another is a career limiting move. If you thought such organisations were risk-averse <em>before</em>, you ain't seen nothing yet.

In this context, Lean and Agile ways of working have been very slow to gain penetration. They have tended to come in at the development team level — right at the tip of the V — as a team-led initiative, coming from smart engineering teams thinking about how they might work better, and seeing effective models in the wider software industry.

However, the rest of the company doesn't work to the same assumptions because it hasn't undergone a similar transformation of mindset. So you have <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/michael.sahota/understanding-and-working-with-agile-culture-pmisoc">a little bubble of Lean/Agile culture</a> operating in one small part of the product value stream, optimising for quality and speed. Outside that bubble are some very different assumptions, which make Lean/Agile working very difficult. These are usually under the heading of governance of one kind or another, be it risk, technical, financial, strategic or other policy based. 

The bubble skin interface quickly becomes a painful place as the two cultures come into conflict. Because Agile's culture is one of <a href="http://agileotter.blogspot.se/2014/02/bringing-back-agile.html?spref=tw&m=1">puritanism</a> and <a href=https://www.scrum.org/ScrumBut">resistance to any kind of compromise</a> to its methods, meeting the needs of anyone from outside &mdash; especially if they're from traditional management &mdash; is <a href="http://www.impaq-solutions.com/impaq-blog/2013/04/corporate-culture-5-monkeys-and-a-banana/">criticised, ridiculed and punished</a>. The only possible response is to make the cell wall thicker, and work hard at not even <em>seeing</em> the needs of the outside world and where they differ from our definitions of what (by our definition) they should need.

<p class="lede">Those different assumptions cause failure in many Agile adoptions.</p>

But of course this is an oversimplification.

By keeping the walls of the bubble so impermeable and obsessing about small teams, we keep the business at bay, rather than engaging them. When we define the relationship with Management as adversarial and complaining that <em>their</em> unsuitability and unwillingness to how we'd like to work is to blame, we set up a self-fulfilling prophesy, further exaggerating the difference between Us and Others, and every day showing how we're not like Those People. And that's simply inviting attack from organisational antibodies. So we build the walls thicker. And higher.

When we build our walls thick and high, we limit our revolution to our part of the value stream, and ensure that there's no risk of their culture invading our fragile world that we keep so pure. And we self justify our failures by complaining that the rest of the system never works in a way that helps us.

<p style="clear:both">But what if we took a different approach?</p>

<h2>Grow the Culture Bubble</h2>

<p class="lede">Once you've established a culture bubble, the way to maximise its benefits is to grow it. Scale the bubble to incorporate ever more of the value stream.</p>

The early Christian church was great at this. Rather than obsessing about keeping separate from the pagan world and wishing it were already converted, it engaged with the world. St Paul, preaching in Athens, absolutely started from where the Athenians were, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-23.htm">talking in terms of an Unknown God they already worshipped</a>.

So having built some organisational trust by making and coming through on commitments, and doing so better than the organisation would expect (and if you're not doing this, then what are you doing bringing disruptive change to an organisation without benefit?), start talking to the immediate teams.

At this point, do <strong>NOT</strong> bring the heavy theology of the Agile Manifesto and weird role names that don't help people understand how to interact with you. 

Start by discovering the needs of those teams. Act as the customer of upstream towards the business, and the supplier of downstream towards production. Understand what being a better customer and supplier would mean for those teams. What are their needs? Not just as expressed, but work hard to uncover the real need.

For example, upstream will often insist on estimates. No matter how convinced you are of the unreliability of bottom up estimating, you won't win that argument by insisting that they're ignorant for wanting them, or by refusing to provide them (if you do that, someone will merely estimate on your behalf, with even <em>less</em> knowledge). 

Understand what need sits underneath the request. Meet that need effectively and the specific request will go away.

Note that this will rarely be technically how, but how to do it in a way that doesn't change the governance framework. Because for sure, a partial implementation within the governance framework is going to be a lot more effective than waiting to change the framework.

However, the business will be tougher, because you will have less common language and experience to fall back on. There, however, the questions will be similar: delivering faster and more responsively to changing business needs sounds like <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/G/Good-Thing.html">A Good Thing</a>. But how do we do that without breaking the governance framework and incurring significant additional risk (that the governance framework is designed to reduce)?

Because - absent an existing crisis and acknowledgement that things are broken and need change - the Kanban Method is spot on in that you can only start from where you are now. Corporate culture is conservative, and if it weren't, you wouldn't need to be having these conversations. It has long experience in a number of behaviours which it considers to be the foundation of its success to date. You're turning up with a critique of those behaviours, but all the evidence is on their side. Put yourself in their shoes: why would you accept change on any rational basis?

So again, you need to show empathy. You need to understand their needs and world view. You need to come up with ways of working that support those needs. And leave the revolutionary language at home.
