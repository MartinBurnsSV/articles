<p class="lede">In a context of iteratively evolving requirements, good architecture must necessarily emerge rather than be pre-planned long in advance. This is valuable as it increases the availability of Options</p>

We must build out the architecture as we are going along, and build it far enough ahead to avoid blocking new business functionality, while still being responsive to how that functionality evolves. 

<blockquote><p>A system that has architectural runway contains existing or planned infrastructure sufficient to allow incorporation of current and anticipated requirements without excessive refactoring</p>
<p><cite>Leffingwell: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Scaling-Software-Agility-Enterprises-Development/dp/0321458192">Scaling Software Agility</a></cite></p></blockquote>
However, <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/real-options-enhance-agility">Options thinking</a> teaches us:
<ol>	<li>Options have value</li>

	<li>Options expire</li>
	<li>Never commit early unless you know why</li>
</ol>

Therefore we need to do better than this; we need to both give ourselves the flexibility to <em>not</em> exercise the Options expressed in anticipated requirements, and to cope with as yet <em>un</em>expressed, unanticipated requirements, at least within a certain boundary of probability

In the context of an enterprise portfolio of products and iteratively evolving functionality delivered by short releases, it answers a major question:

<blockquote><p>What technology initiatives need to be underway now so that we can reliably deliver a new <ins>(as yet undefined)</ins> class of features in the next year or so?</p>

This increases our Options in the future, as it gives us a wider range of possible functionality we can build, while allowing us to delay commitment to 
Resolving technical debt is a special class of Architectural Runway also allows us to delay commitment, providing increased options for what we might build.
