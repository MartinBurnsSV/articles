<p class="lede">In knowledgework, visual management is essential to expose the reality of invisible work. But it's too easy to over-rely on visual management and assume that it <em>is</em> the work, or that the visual management display is the <span lang="ja" style="font-style: italic;">gemba</span>.</p>

Lean thinkers place an enormous amount of emphasis on the reality of the <span lang="ja" style="font-style: italic;">gemba</span> — the workplace where the actual value creation goes on. There are legion stories of the first generation of Lean <span lang="ja" style="font-style: italic;">Senseis</span> barging past the conference rooms prepared for their diagnostic visit with charts upon charts of performance and analysis, heading instead straight for the shop floor to see past management self-delusion and misdirection to where facts cannot be hidden. It's a common exercise for the budding Lean manager in manufacturing to be told to go and stand in a small circle next to the production line for an hour or a day, and come back with a list of <a title="Improving Lean Practise. DOWNTIME Better Wastes Acronym than TIMWOOD" href="http://everydaylean.info/2011/10/improving-lean-practise-downtime-better-wastes-acronym-than-timwood/">Wastes</a> on show. Woe betide the youngster if they came back with an empty list; they'd be returned to the circle immediately with an instruction to look <em>harder</em>.

This is easy though in manufacturing. Value creation acts on physical objects. Inventory physically piles up on shelves (if you're lucky). But in knowledgework, work is invisible. Flow of work is invisible. Problems — both tactical and systemic &mdash; are invisible.
