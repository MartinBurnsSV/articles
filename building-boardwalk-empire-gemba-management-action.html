<h2>Description</h2>
	Knowledge work has a fundamental problem: it is invisible. Flow of value is hidden in documents, systems and people's heads. Improving and unblocking the flow relies on making the invisible visible to individuals and accessible to their inspection and interactions.

	In this roleplaying taster workshop, you will experience 
	<ol>
		<li>The power of visual management at the workplace to enable more effective team-management dialogue.</li>
		<li>Behaviour patterns that build a learning culture to better meet team, management and organisational needs.</li>
	</ol>
	The workshop will go beyond simple information flow to building better behaviours to act on the information. You will engage in active coaching dialogues and take part in continuous improvement processes.

	You might also pick up a few visual management nuggets that you find helpful.

<h2 id="moreinfo">Additional description</h2>

	This workshop runs as multiple rounds, based on a daily management visit to teams, using their boards to prompt a coaching dialogue that covers not only what the team knows but what their visual management shows (known and unknown knowns). This will cover impediments and improvements.

	Attendees play managers and team members, and will develop an understanding of management and organisational needs as they visit teams with pre-defined in a system of interlinked teams.

	The learning approach uses the powerful Training Within Industry Job Instruction method that Toyota use with great success:
	<ol>
		<li>Demonstrate without commentary</li>
		<li>Demonstrate and explain</li>
		<li>Learner performs without commentary</li>
		<li>Learner performs and explains</li>
	</ol>
