<p class="lede">Spreading culture is hard if you do it confrontationally. Gain entry, develop trust and gradually change from the inside.</p>

So, you want to change the corporation to a Lean/Agile culture? But you know that your values and culture are significantly different from the corporation, and to do so openly will invite being resisted strongly.

Good. Welcome to the problem that evangelical movements have faced forever.

While you have to acknowledge the persistence of the Mormons and Jehova's Witnesses, or the people selling Socialist Worker, you have to admit that their success rate isn't great, not least because they attract strong opposition.

So let's take a lesson from effective forms of Spreading The Word. Specifically, let's learn from both the Early Church, and Trotskyist Entryism.

<h2>Methods of Power</h2>

	This is the Revolutionary Political view of change. If you think that Lean/Agile doesn't have a political wing, then consider this: how often have you heard (or even said) something along the lines of one of the following:

	* We don't need (project) managers
	* I like the idea of Holocracy
	* Teams should be self-organising

	or if you have cited Dilbert as having any insight into the working life.

	Those are all political statements, because it is a struggle of different groups over who has power (or if you prefer the softer term: influence) over what things get done, and how they are done.

	There is a risk here: if the host organisation realises what's happening at an early stage, then it will <a href=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19860227&id=5rdAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=y6UMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4149,6183772">strongly resist you</a>. Because what you are engaged in is fundamentally changing the power structure. And the existing power structure never likes it when that happens.

<h2>Methods of Culture</h2>

	<h3>1. Gain Entry</h3>
	<h3>2. Change the Meaning</h3>
	<h3>3. Change the Language</h3>
	<h3>4. Change the Name</h3>



Of course, this will cause apoplexy in the doctrine obsessed fundamentalists. 

Good.
