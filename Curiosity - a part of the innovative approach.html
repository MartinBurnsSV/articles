<p class="lede">A common question at this point is; which method should we use to start developing this high-performing and responsive organization? </p>

I want to emphasize that there is no need for an all-encompassing methodology. This means that the group or organization may use any methodology they want. Instead I advocate (and also offer) a simple framework which incorporate and supplement whatever methodology the organization is using. This framework is based on one foundation, with four related principles.

The foundation is simply to primarily work with the reality before the plan. Well, aimless work then? No, on the contrary, as one of the four principles below decree. Here are four principles in turn:
 
</h3>1. Supportive approach</h3>
The first and perhaps most important principle is all about our attitude towards our surrounding. Where we have a genuine interest in other people. For example, I think plenty of others, until proven otherwise. I enjoy working with others, and others enjoy working with me. Or as the African proverb says; <q>If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go further, go together.</q> 
 
<h3>2. Value Driven</h3>
First and foremost, value driven is not about core values ​​and such. Value Driven is all about delivering value based on a purpose. Our vision is to create value every day, where the purpose of my work is my guiding light. Goals and objectives are thereby subordinated to this principle. Or if you want; goals and objectives are developed based on the principle of (for example) value-driven cooperation.

<h3>3. Iterative planning</h3>
This is the most comprehensive and complex principle. But if I should keep it short, it's about to let go of old paradigms about the plan-driven planning, and from a cyclical perspective plan on multiple levels - simultaneously.
 
<h3>4. Incremental development</h4>
Classically there are separate processes for change management, which can sometimes serve as countermeasures for new conditions. High-performing organizations assumes that things will change, and therefore have change management built-in to its daily work. A little sloppy, you can translate this principle into pragmatic change management. But it is never arbitrary, instead this principle is fairly rigorous.
